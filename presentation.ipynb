    "\n",
    "**Git** is a **version control system (VCS)** that lets you track changes to files over time. These files can be any kind of file (eg doc, pdf, xls), but free text differences are most easily visible (eg txt, csv, md). You can rollback changes made by you, or others. This facilitates a **playground for collaboration**, without fear of experimentation (you can always rollback changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Github** is a **website** for storing your **git versioned files** remotely. It has many nice features to be able to visualize differences in files. It's mostly designed to facilitate a technical conversation between commits, pull requests, issues and particular lines of code. It's also great for **project management**, with the ability to link issues, milestones and commits."

This main branch typically represents a stable version of your code and this will be the code which is released or published.\n",
