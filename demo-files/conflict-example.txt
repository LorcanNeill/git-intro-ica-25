# Conflict Resolution Practice File

This file is designed to help you practice resolving merge conflicts.

## Current Content (Main Branch)

This is the original content that exists on the main branch.
Students should modify this section to create conflicts.

### Features
- Basic functionality
- Simple interface
- Easy to use

### TODO List
- Add more features
- Improve documentation
- Fix bugs

### Notes
This is a collaborative file where multiple students can work together.
Each student should create their own branch and make changes to this file.
Then, when merging back to main, conflicts will occur that need to be resolved.

## Instructions for Conflict Practice

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-name`
2. Edit this file and add your own section
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am "Add my section"`
4. Switch back to main: `git checkout main`
5. Have another student make changes to the same area
6. Try to merge your branch: `git merge feature/your-name`
7. Resolve the conflicts that appear
8. Complete the merge

## Tips for Conflict Resolution

- Look for the conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>
- Decide which changes to keep, or combine them
- Remove the conflict markers
- Test your changes
- Commit the resolved conflicts

Good luck with your Git practice!
